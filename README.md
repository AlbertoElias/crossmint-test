This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Admin Panel

Navigate manually to /admin to access the admin panel. You'll need to use the password used in the environment variable `NEX_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. This allows you to update minted NFTs as they change status. Factory => Warehouse => In Transit => Delivered

__Note: This is just a demo with no proper authentication.__

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
